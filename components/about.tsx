          <p>
            I&apos;ve always been a great problem solver, an independent introvert, and a 
            technophile obsessed with the latest technologies. Currently, I&apos;m working 
            as a Software Engineer at IMpulse (BD) Ltd. with over 3 years of experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&apos;m familiar with a variety of programming languages, including C#, JavaScript, 
            Java, Python, and frameworks like ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, 
            and Angular - but I&apos;m always adding new skills to my repository.
          </p>
          <p>
            I prefer working from home sometimes as I find I can get more work done there. 
            I&apos;m also eager to connect with other software engineers, so feel free to reach out!
